# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about content trends, country-wise production, and yearly releases. Using SQL, we perform various queries to explore content distribution, the longest movie, and the growth of Netflix content over the years.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains information about Netflix titles, including:
- **Title** â€“ Name of the movie/show.
- **Director** â€“ Name of the director(s).
- **Cast** â€“ Leading actors.
- **Country** â€“ Country where the content was produced.
- **Release Year** â€“ The year when the content was added.
- **Duration** â€“ The length of the movie or show.
- Few other columns including show_id, description, date_added, rating, Genre(Listed in)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
2. Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
3. List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
4. Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.
